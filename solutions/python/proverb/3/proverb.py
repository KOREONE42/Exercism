def proverb(*items, qualifier=None):
    """
    Generate a proverb illustrating a cascading chain of consequences.

    For a given list of items, each line describes how the absence of one
    caused the loss of the next. The proverb ends with a line summarizing
    that all was lost due to the first missing item, optionally modified
    by a qualifier.

    Example:
        proverb("nail", "shoe", "horse") returns:
        [
            "For want of a nail the shoe was lost.",
            "For want of a shoe the horse was lost.",
            "And all for the want of a nail."
        ]

    Args:
        *items (str): Ordered sequence of elements representing the chain.
        qualifier (str, optional): An optional word to prepend to the first item in the final line.

    Returns:
        list[str]: The constructed proverb as a list of lines.
