def proverb(*items, qualifier=None):
    """
    Construct a proverb from a sequence of related items, illustrating a chain of consequences.

    Each line describes how the lack of one item led to the loss of the next, following this pattern:
        "For want of a <item> the <next item> was lost."

    The final line summarizes the chain:
        "And all for the want of a <qualifier> <first item>."
    If no qualifier is provided, it defaults to:
        "And all for the want of a <first item>."

    Parameters:
        *items (str): A variable number of strings representing items in the chain of loss.
        qualifier (str, optional): A modifier for the first item in the final line.

    Returns:
        list[str]: A list of proverb lines forming the complete chain.
