def proverb(*items, qualifier=None):
    """
    Generate a proverb based on a sequence of cascading losses.

    Each line follows the pattern:
        "For want of a <item> the <next item> was lost."

    The final line summarizes the chain with:
        "And all for the want of a <qualifier> <first item>."
    or if no qualifier is provided:
        "And all for the want of a <first item>."

    Parameters:
    - *items: A variadic list of strings representing the sequence.
    - qualifier (str, optional): A word to qualify the first item in the final line.

    Returns:
    - A list of strings forming the proverb.
