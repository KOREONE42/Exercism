    Determines if a list of dominoes can be arranged in a circular chain where adjacent dominoes match
    and the chain ends where it started (i.e., forms a loop). Each domino is represented as a tuple (a, b).
    
    Parameters:
    dominoes (list of tuple): A list of domino pieces, each represented as a 2-tuple of integers.

    Returns:
    list of tuple or None: A valid circular domino chain if possible, otherwise None.
