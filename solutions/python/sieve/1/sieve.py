def primes(limit):
    """
    Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to and including the given limit.

    A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
    This function marks non-prime numbers (multiples of each prime) in a boolean list and returns
    all numbers that remain marked as prime.

    Parameters:
        limit (int): The upper bound of the range to search for prime numbers (inclusive).

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of all prime numbers less than or equal to the limit.
